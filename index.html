      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
      <p>While the internet continues to evolve significantly by improving our everyday lives, it comes
         with a irreplaceable price of compromising our data,privacy and time. In this article we are going to be looking at all the dangers and how we can stay away from them even when everything could be closely watched out there. Famous Tech giants and social media platforms like Snapchat, Facebook and Gmail might be collecting more data than we think. A glimpse of this can be seen in Netflix's social dilemma in which former tech experts working in the silicon valley shred some light on the marketing strategies behind these companies and reveal how they continuously track their users every move to find new ways for them to keep revisiting their sites. Not only have these companies claimed of collecting their users data but have also accepted of selling it to other advertising companies. Despite this some people still think that its completely okay for these companies to store their personal information in their database just because they have got nothing to hide. However, I have got mixed views regarding those people since I think that everyone has got something to hide even when they say they have got nothing to hide. Assuming even if one hasn't got anything to hide, their current location, credit card numbers or their personal photos are examples of all those things which 
        anyone would want to hide in order to protect them from falling in the wrong hands.</p>

        <h2><b>How can we enjoy Internets positive side wiithout compromising our data?</b></h2>
        <p>While there are a tons of different methods of protecting our data online, I am going to be sharing a few of my favorite ones and how you could use them to protect your data as well. All you are going to be needing is an active internet connection and a smartphone or a laptop in working condition to follow the steps listed down below: 1. Try using an encrypted email service provider like proton mail, a Switzerland based company whose sole aim is to focus on their users privacy by providing them with end to end encrypted communications so that no one else except their user and the person whom they are communicating with can see their mails. 2. Those who love to browse anonymously by staying hidden on the internet but don't want anyone knowing about browsing history including their internet service provider and the browser itself wouldn't want to miss on this second tip. Installing "Tor Browser" should maintain our anonymity by hiding our IP address and eliminating any threats which could possibly lead to network surveillance. 3. In today's day of the world where our data is our everything, it is going to be a pity if we were to lose it all just because of something as small as setting a weak password. I believe that we should keep passwords which are hard to guess but easy to remember because there is going to be no point in keeping passwords which we ourselves aren't going to remember. Since data breaches are happening on a regular basis so its important we also try and change our passwords on a regular basis in order to avoid any of our accounts from being hacked. 4) This last tip is going to be helpful for those users whose laptops keep on getting infected by viruses. If you are one of them so you would want to go in your laptops security settings and scan for windows in built virus scan to search for viruses if you are on a windows pc. When done with the scan you might want to go in the control panel and check if your in built firewall is enabled and in case its switched off by default so you might want to enable it right away in order to stay away from these annoying viruses in the future.</p>
       <h3><b>How did Edward Snowdens leaks changed peoples perception about the Internet?</b>
</h3>
<p>Edward Snowden, a NSA whistle blower whose leaks took the internet on fire when he was accused of copying hundreds of highly classified documents on a pen drive and leaking them to the Guardian accused the Government of the United States of conducting illegal surveillance on their citizens. Snowden was a former employee of the NSA (National Security Agency), CIA and is also believed to have later worked as a sub contractor for the NSA. According to Snowden he felt it his duty to make people aware about how easy could it be for government agencies and other organizations to remotely spy on their personal devices without their consent. While his leaks proved out to be eye opening for some people, he was declared as a traitor by the NSA for jeopardizing their countries national security by revealing classified information. MY OPINION ABOUT THE INTERNET I think while the internet has made our lives tremendously easier by connecting us all together and making information on anything and everything more accessible, it has also put a question mark on our privacy by allowing these companies to collect too much information about us. If these companies were to get involved in a data breach tomorrow, our data would be out there in the open and could be easily misused against our interests to hurt us. That's the reason why I feel that these companies need to change their privacy policy and structure them in a way where they collect minimal amount of data against us respecting our privacy creating a safe environment for us online.
